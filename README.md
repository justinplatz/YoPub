#Using PubNub for Simplified Swift Push Notifications


It is difficult to overemphasize the power of mobile push notifications in your app. There is virtually no other tool that allows you to tap almost two billion people on the shoulder.

Push notifications arenâ€™t a new invention, but as mobile handset growth continues to accelerate along with increasing  IoT connected devices, push alerts only become more important as a method for applications to pass on pressing information and re-engage their users. 

Push notifications can be an ingenious way to prompt a mobile user at the right place, at the right time, regarding the right piece of information. 

If you observed the impressive splash made by the mobile messaging app Yo, then you may have seen how impactful a simple push notification can be.

In this project I will show you how you can use PubNub & Swift to easily implement push notifications across many different channels by creating a Yo-esque app.
